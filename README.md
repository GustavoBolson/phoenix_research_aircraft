# phoenix_research_aircraft
In an effort to apply my knowledge gained in engineering undergraduate up until this point in a real world, systems engineering based, all-phases design, I will be designing a series of small uncrewed research aircraft to test both aircraft design technics and electronic systems ranging from control to scientific payload that could benefit from having a low-cost, variable acceleration environment. This is supposed to be an easy access venue for future researchers and students who want to replicate my findings or just anyone interested in small planes in general. Fell free to use it on your own project just citing my name and the version that you used.
